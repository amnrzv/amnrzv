Hi, I’m @amnrzv

I’m interested in most things related to front-end development but particularly interested in:

- 🧑‍🎨 building scalable design systems,
- 🏎 improving page performance,
- ♿️ making sites and apps accessibile, and
- 🕺 smooth animations!


I’m currently learning to build more accessible websites.

You can get in touch with me on my twitter -> [__rzv](https://twitter.com/__rzv)
